# OpenSetRecognition
This project focuses on Open Set Recognition (OSR), a critical problem in deep learning where a model must accurately classify known classes while identifying unseen (out-of-distribution) samples as "Unknown." Unlike traditional classification, OSR requires distinguishing in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data during inference.
